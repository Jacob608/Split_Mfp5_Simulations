Parameter and topology files in this folder have been modified to include HT and OT atom types to account for tip3 water molecules. HT OT bond coefficients, HT OT HT angle coefficients, and LJ non bonded parameters have been added. Parameters for sodium and chloride from **toppar_water_ions.str** have also been copied into **par_all36_prot_C2L_TIP3_OH_CLA_SOD.prm** and **top_all36_prot_C2L_TIP3_OH_CLA_SOD.rtf**

Topology file **top_all36_prot_C2L_TIP3_OH_CLA_SOD.rtf** has been modified to include the topology for the DOPA residue, which is fully defined by standard CHARMM atom types.
